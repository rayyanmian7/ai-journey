# What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI that understands and generates human language.

Examples include:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini

LLMs work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on patterns in huge amounts of text data.

Key ideas:
- They do not "think" like humans.
- They generate responses based on probability.
- They can be very powerful but also make mistakes.
