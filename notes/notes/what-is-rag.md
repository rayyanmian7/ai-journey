# What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

It means giving an AI model your own documents so it can answer based on them, instead of only its training data.

Example:
If you upload your school notes, a chatbot can answer questions from those notes.

Why RAG is useful:
- More accurate answers
- Uses your real information
- Reduces AI mistakes
